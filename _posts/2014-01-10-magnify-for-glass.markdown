I have somewhat poor vision, something like 20/80 corrected. It
doesn't severly impact my life, although I often have trouble reading
text others have no trouble seeing, like the menu at McDonald's or
street signs while driving. I always thought thtat technology should
be able to solve this problem, and to some extent it does. I carry
around a tiny monocular telescope that I use in classrooms or at
sporting events. People look at me funny, but it works. However, I
always thought there might be a better solution.

So even before Glass was announced, I was dreaming up ways that
advanced augmented reality devices might be able to help me out. I
started to design a pair of goggles myself by combining webcams and VR
glasses, but then Glass was announced the next month.

Now that I have this device, it seems like I should just write this
technology myself! I mean, how hard can zooming be?

As it turns out: kinda difficult. I have some quirks to iron out (such
as crashes and lag), but I'd like to introduce [Magnify for Glass][magnify]. I
wouldn't use it yet, as it isn't stable, but I'll make sure to update
this post when it is!

Here's an example:
